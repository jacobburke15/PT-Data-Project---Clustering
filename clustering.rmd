# DATA CLEANING							

Our data cleaning process is basically divided into 3 steps. Firstly, we looked into each column, detected and dealt with unusual values. Secondly, we determined the effectiveness of each therapeutic process based on the evaluation criteria of each outcome type. Specifically, we evaluated the effectiveness of pain reduction and the overall improvement. Then, we aggregated some therapy summaries which were logically duplicated, and reevaluated them by taking average. 

### i)

In the first step, we mainly worked on fixing typos, removing repeated rows, detected and fixed (or removed) problematic values. Typos are general problems caused by inconsistent upper/lower case spelling. And there are many special problems for each column, we analyzed and determined how to smooth the potential errors:

(a) We deleted the record with discharge date in June 2020. 

(b) We deleted a 7-digit ROMS ID.

(c) We deleted the negative age and adjusted the inconsistent age based on earlier therapy record.

(d) We adjusted chronic pain as NA if values for chronic pain conflicted with itself. 

(e) We fixed inconsistent admission date and discharge date. Particularly, holding other criteria constant (ID, classification, body region, outcome and admission date), if the discharge date varied, then we adjusted all the discharge dates to be the same as the last discharge date of this therapy. Similarly, holding other criteria constant (ID, classification, body region, outcome and discharge date), if the admission date varied, then we adjusted all the admission dates to be the same as the first admission date of this therapy.

(f) After the data cleaning steps mentioned above, we grouped the data by conditions including ROMS ID, Body Region, Outcome, Classification, Admission Date and Discharge Date. We defined each group of data as a combination of therapy records during one entire treatment process.  Then we recounted visit times and the time(days) during one entire therapy.

(g) We removed the outcome scores that were out of range. The maximum possible value for LOWER EXTREMITY FUNC SCALE is 80, we eliminated the records for those LOWER EXTREMITY FUNC SCALE values larger than 80 (applied to either admission scores or discharge scores).

### ii)

In the second step, we evaluated the effectiveness of pain reduction and the overall improvement of each treatment and gave binary scores to them.\newline

(a) For pain result, if pain scores were reduced by at least 2 points, or reduced from less than 2 to 0, then pain reduction effectiveness was good, we assigned 1 to the result. Otherwise, we considered the therapyâ€™s effectiveness of pain reduction was not good, and we assigned 0 to the result.

(b) For overall outcome result, we needed to specify different criteria for different outcome types:
    (1) When outcome type was LOWER EXTREMITY FUNC SCALE, if the score increased at least 9 points or increased from larger than 71 to 80 (max), then we considered the treatment is effective overall, and we assigned the overall effect with score 1. Otherwise, we gave the overall effect with score 0.
    
    (2) when outcome type was KNEE OUTCOME SURVEY, if the score increased at least 9 points or increased from larger than 91 to 100 (max), then we considered the treatment is effective overall, and we assigned the overall effect with score 1. Otherwise, we gave the overall effect with score 0.
    
    (3) When outcome belongs to other 3 types, if the score decreased at least 10 points or decreased from less than 10 to 0 (minimum), then we considered the treatment is effective overall, and we assigned the overall effect with score 1. Otherwise, we gave the overall effect with score 0.

### iii)

After those 2 steps, then we aggregated some therapy summaries and evaluated them by taking average.	
For the treatments with identical same ID, body region, classification and treatment time, if the categories of outcome are different, we took the average of the pain reduction effectiveness scores (1 or 0) and took the average of the effect for overall improvement (1 or 0). Since we aggregated some rows, some columns became invalid logically, so they are assigned NA.
